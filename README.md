# 🎨 Color preview ( RGB Pattern )

### Hi there! 👋🏻 This is the first project I made with JS without guidance. The idea was to make a page that can show you the color writted in rgb pattern.
### I'm working in an update to make it more versatile and less tedious.

# How it workds ...

### You only need to put the values you want on the left in the order:
***
## 1. Red
## 2. Green
## 3. Blue
***
### And then press the left button to see the change on the right side.
### Pressing the right button, you can reset the values making it black again.
